# framework improvements:

. we can implement hooks and tags to parameterise tests.  
. we can create saparate steps file for each and every page.  
. we can create configuaration file to read properties, so we no need to hard code varibles.  
. we can share code between the classes using scenario context model or depedency injection model.   
. we can create detailed reports with extent report.   
. we can run tests from cmd line with cucumber options.   
. we can integrate to jenkins and schedule excution.   
. we can run test parallel.   
. we can connect to databases and excute commands if necessary.  
. we can create the utility classes for common code.  

# Test sttategy for go boston website.

. I just added the 3 pages scenario with page object model pattern and junit unit testing framework.  
. but we can still do lot of scenarios like end to end scenarios validating the price and number of customers etc..
. we can automate all the links are working.  
. we can automate each and every page based on the functionality with postive and negetive scenarios.
. we can automate API's with rest assured or soapUI tools if necessary.  
. we can automate mobile web browser or the app with tools like appium if necessary.  

Thank you.
